# Uptask Backend  

A robust RESTful API built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB** for managing projects and tasks in a to-do list application. This backend supports CRUD operations for projects and tasks, along with user authentication and two-factor authentication using JWT.  

⚠️ **Note:** This project is under active development and subject to changes as features are refined and added.  

---

## Features  

- **CRUD Operations**:  
  - Create, retrieve, update, and delete projects.  
  - Add, retrieve, update, and delete tasks within a project.  

- **User Authentication**:  
  - Secure user registration and login.  
  - Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) implemented using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.  

- **TypeScript-Powered**:  
  - Strongly typed codebase for maintainability and scalability.
